- **Creative/Hospitality** (Freelancer, Restaurant, E-commerce): Balanced personality with business credibility

### Print Considerations
- All images must work well in grayscale/black-white printing
- High contrast elements for professional appearance
- Avoid complex gradients or fine details
- Ensure transparency works correctly when printed

### Professional Standards
- Images must convey business credibility and professionalism
- Suitable for B2B client communications
- Appropriate for government and enterprise submissions
- Maintain Austrian business culture standards

## Usage Instructions

1. Use these prompts with AI image generation tools (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
2. **CRITICAL**: Always specify "PNG format with transparent background" in prompts
3. Generate images at exact specified dimensions (64x64px, 150x60px, 300x300px)
4. Ensure PNG format with full alpha channel transparency support
5. Test images in both color and grayscale print scenarios
6. Verify watermarks maintain appropriate opacity levels (8-15%)
7. Use exact hex color codes provided in each styleguide
8. Save with exact filenames: `icon_square.png`, `logo_rectangle.png`, `watermark.png`

### AI Image Generation Tips
- For DALL-E: Add "transparent background, PNG format" at the end of each prompt
- For Midjourney: Use `--ar 1:1` for icons, `--ar 2.5:1` for logos, and specify "transparent background"
- For Stable Diffusion: Use "transparent background, PNG, alpha channel" in negative prompts
- Always verify transparency by placing generated images over different colored backgrounds

### Color Palette Integration
Each template includes specific hex color codes that should be used consistently across all three image types (logo, icon, watermark) to maintain brand coherence within the invoice design.
